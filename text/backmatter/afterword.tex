I thank you greatly for having read through the entirety of the book and hope that you enjoyed yourself whilst doing so. I have, to the best of my abilities, tried doing the original work justice, so that not only the unique and colourful manner in which John wrote his Revelation is translated properly, but also so that it becomes accessible and enjoyable for as many people as possible.
