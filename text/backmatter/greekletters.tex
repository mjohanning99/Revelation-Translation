As this edition of John's Apocalypse contains not only my own translation but also the original Greek text, I believed it to be helpful to include herein a small overview of the various letters of the Greek alphabet and their equivalent transliteration in English. 

As this is merely supposed to be a short guideline for the slightly-above-casual reader unaccustomed to the Greek alphabet — or, perhaps, having rudimentary knowledge thereof —, I decided against fully-fledged explanations of the various breathings and accents, and I also decided against describing their pronunciations; for, indeed, there exist such a large number of varying ways of pronouncing the Ancient Greek language that showcasing them all herein would not be possible. 

Instead, I recommend this table to be used simply as a quick reference guide for those who wish to read a handful of words in the Greek text — but are, due to their never having learnt the alphabet, unable to do so on their own —, or for those who have begun studying Greek only recently and still require help in reading the glyphs.
