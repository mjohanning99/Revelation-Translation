If this book has fuelled your desire to learn not only more about the Apocalypse of John and the Bible in general, but also the Ancient Greek language, I believe the following section might be of interest to you. For I have, over the course of my studying Ancient Greek, made good use of a rather large repertoire of various resources and would like to showcase those I believe to be most helpful. 

First and foremost, I highly recommend JACT's ``Reading Greek'' series for commencing your study of the Ancient Greek language. In this series, as opposed to more traditional grammar books, you learn the language by reading as much as possible as soon as possible — as, indeed, the name should have revealed. If you do decide to get yourself a copy of the \textit{Reading Greek} series, I also highly recommend the Italian edition of ``Athenaze'', as it contains a very large amount of beginner-friendly prose. I cannot, however, recommend \textit{Athenaze} as one's only method of learning the language, as it does contain a not insignificant amount of Italian — thus, unless you speak Italian reasonably well, I can only recommend this book as a pairing to the aforementioned \textit{Reading Greek} series.

If you wish to continue reading the New Testament in its original language, my personal favourite is ``The Greek New Testament: A Reader's Edition''.
