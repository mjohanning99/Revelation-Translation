		\lettrine[lines=3]{A}{nd} I saw an angel coming down from Heaven, having the keys of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. And he seized the dragon — the ancient serpent — who is (the) Devil and (the) Satan and he bound him for a thousand years. And he threw him into the abyss and he locked and sealed (the opening) above him so that he may no longer deceive the nations until the thousand years have passed (lit. are finished). And thereafter he must be loosened for a little while. 
		\pend
		\pstart
		And I saw thrones and they (the apostles / saints) sat upon them and (the authority to pass) a judgement was given to them; and their souls were beheaded because of the witness of Jesus and because of the word of God and whoever did not worship the beast or its idol (and whoever did) not take the mark upon his forehead and upon his hand. And they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. The remaining of the dead did not live until the thousand years have passed (lit. have finished). This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is he who has a part in the first resurrection, (for) the second death has no authority over them but they will (instead) be priests of God and Christ; and they will reign with Him for a thousand years. 
		\pend
		\pstart
		And when the thousand years have passed (lit. are finished), Satan will be freed from his prison and he will come out to deceive the nations, (namely) those in the four corners of the Earth — (the) Gog and Magog — (and he does this in order) to gather (and prepare) them (to go) into battle; (and) their number is as (large) as the (amount of grains of) sand of the sea. And they went up onto the breadth of the Earth (land) (i. e. they covered its entire breadth) and they surrounded the camp of the holy men and the (be)loved city. And fire descended out of Heaven and ate them (up). And the Devil — the one who deceived them (their deceiver) — was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone (sulphur); (the same place) where even the beast and the false prophet will be tormented day and night into the eternity of eternities (forever).
		\pend
		\pstart
		And I saw a great, white throne and (I saw) him who sits upon it, from whose face the Earth and the Heaven fled — and no place was found for them. And I saw the dead — the great and the small — standing before the throne; and books were opened. And another book was opened, (the one) which is (the book) of life. And the dead were judged according to their deeds (as they were recorded in) from the writings of the books. And the sea gave (up) the dead (that were) within it, and Death and Hades gave (up) the dead (which were) within them; and they were each judged according to their deeds. And Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death — the lake of fire. And if someone (’s name) was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.
