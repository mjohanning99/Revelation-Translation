		And I saw a strong angel coming down from Heaven — clad in a cloud — and the (a) rainbow was upon his head and his face was like the Sun and his feet were like flaming pillars and he had in his hands a small, open book. And he put his right foot upon the sea and the left (one) upon the Earth and shouted in a great voice like a roaring lion. And when he cried out in a great voice, the seven thunders spoke (in) their voices (made their voices heard). 
		\pend 
		\pstart
		And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write; and (but) I heard a voice from Heaven saying, “Seal (and lock away) that which the thunders spoke — and do not write (about) it. And the angel — the one I saw standing upon the Earth and the Sea — raised his right hand (and reached with it) into Heaven and swore in (the name of) Him who lives into the eternity of eternities, who bore (not only) Heaven and the those things that are within it (but also) the Earth and that within it and the sea and that within it; (and he swore) that time shall be no longer. 
		\pend
		\pstart
		But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel — when he will (begin to) sound (his trumpet) — the mystery of God — as he has preached to his servants, (namely) the prophets — will end. And the voice which I heard (coming) from Heaven (was) again speaking to me saying, “Arise and take the opened book — the one (placed) inside the hands of the angel standing upon the sea and the Earth.”
		\pend
		\pstart
		And I went to the angel, telling him to give me the small book. And he says to me, “Take it and eat it up; and it will make your stomach bitter, but it in your mouth it shall be as sweet as honey.” And I took the small book out of the angel’s hand and ate it; and it was in my mouth like sweet honey, but (and) when I swallowed (ate) it, it made my stomach bitter. And they (he?) tell me, “You must once again prophesy before many peoples and nations and tongues (languages) and kings.”
