		\lettrine[lines=3]{A}{fter} this I saw — and look! — a door having been opened in Heaven and the first voice I heard — (which spoke) like a trumpet — was speaking to me, saying, “Come up here and I will show you what must happen hereafter. Immediately I was in Spirit, and look! A throne (chair) placed within Heaven and someone was sitting on it; and He who was sitting on it was in appearance like a jasper and carnelian stone and a rainbow was around the throne, which looked as if it was made out of emeralds. And around the throne were (another) twenty-four thrones and upon those thrones were sitting twenty-four elders, (all) clad in white garments and upon their heads were golden crowns. And from the throne (there) came forth (bolts of) lightning, voices and thunder; and (there were) seven flaming torches burning before the throne which were the seven Spirits of God; and (the region) before the throne (was) as the Sea made of glass, like a crystal.
		\pend
		\pstart
		And in the middle of the throne and around the throne (there were) four living creatures, covered with eyes from back to front. And the first creature was like a lion, and the second creature was like a bull and the third creature had the head of a human, and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle. And the four creatures each had six wings (which) were filled with eyes around and within. And without a break — day and night — they were saying, “Holy, holy, holy (is the) Lord God, the Almighty, who was and is and who will come.”
		\pend

		Whenever the creatures give glory, honour and thanks to Him who sits upon the throne — He who will live into the eternity of eternities —, the twenty-four elders fall before the One sitting upon the throne and worship Him who lives into the eternity of eternities. And they throw their crowns before the throne, saying, “You are worthy, our Lord and God, of taking the glory, honour and power, for You created (the) everything; and through Your wish we were and were created.”
