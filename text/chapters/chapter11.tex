		\lettrine[lines=3]{A}{nd} there was given to me a reed (which looked) like a stick (rod, staff) (and there was someone there) saying, “Arise and measure the Temple of God and the altar and the ones who pray therein. And the courtyard (that is) outside of the altar, cast (it) (leave it) outside and do not measure it; for it is given to the non-Israelites (gentiles, foreigners) and (through) the Holy City they will walk on foot for forty-two months. 
		\pend
		\pstart
		And I shall give (the authority to) my two witnesses and they shall prophesy for one-thousand two-hundred sixty days (whilst) clad in sackcloths. They are the two olive trees and the two lamp-stands who are standing before the Lord of the Earth. And if someone wishes to harm them, fire (will) come out of their mouths and (the fire will) eat their enemies; and if someone wishes to harm them, this is the manner in which he (the person doing harm) will have to be killed. 	
		\pend
		\pstart
		They have the authority to lock up Heaven so that rain shall not fall (upon the Earth) during the days of their prophecy; and they (also) hold the authority over the waters — to turn them into blood — and (they have the authority to) smite the Earth with (in) every plague as they please. And when they have finished their witness, the beast coming out of the abyss fights (does battle / war) with them and it will prevail over them and kill them. 
		\pend
		\pstart
		And their dead body (bodies) (will lie) upon the road of the great city, (the one) which is called — in Spirit (spiritually) — Sodom and Egypt; (it is the same place) where even their Lord was crucified. And from (every) peoples and tribe and tongue and nation there are some that (will) look at their corpses for three and a half days, and will not allow their corpses to be buried into a grave. 
		\pend
		\pstart
		And the inhabitants of the Earth (will) rejoice over them (because they died) and celebrate, and they will send presents to one another, for these two prophets tormented (tortured) the inhabitants of the Earth. But (and) after these three and a half days, the living Spirit of God entered into them; and they arose (and stood) upon their feet and a great fear fell upon those who watch them. 
		\pend
		\pstart
		And they heard a great voice speaking to them from heaven (and it said), “Come up here!” And they went up into Heaven on (in) the cloud, and their enemies saw them. And in that (particular) hour, a great tremor occurred and a tenth of the cities (of the Earth) fell (collapsed). And through (in) the tremor there died the names of seven-thousand people; and the remaining became terrified and gave glory to the God of Heaven. The second Woe departed; look, the third Woe arrives shortly. 
		\pend
		\pstart
		And the seventh angel sounded (his trumpet). And there were great voices in Heaven saying, ''The kingdom of the cosmos (world, universe) has come (happened, arrived?) — (which is) the kingdom of our Lord and his Messiah — and he will reign into the eternity of eternities.`` And the twenty-four elders — (the ones) which are sitting upon their thrones before God — fell to their faces and worshipped God saying, ''We thank You, Lord our God the Almighty — (He) who is and who was — for You have taken Your great power and ruled (reigned). And the nations were angry and (then) there came Your wrath and (there also came) the time for the dead to be judged (by You) and (the time for You) to give the reward to your servants — the prophets — and to the holy men and to the ones who fear Your name — be they small or great; (and there also came the time) to destroy the destroyers of the Earth.``
		\pend
		\pstart
		And the Temple of God was opened in Heaven, and the ark of His testament appeared. And there were (many bolts of) lightning and voices and thunders and a tremor and great hail(storm).
