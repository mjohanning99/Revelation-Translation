        			\chapter{The Star Having Fallen from Heaven}
				]
		And the fifth angel sounded (his trumpet). And I saw a star having fallen from Heaven (down on)to Earth and the key to the well of the abyss (bottomless pit) was given to him; and he opened the well of the abyss. And there came forth a great smoke from the well, like (the) smoke of a great furnace; and the Sun and the air were darkened (overshadowed) from (because of, through) the smoke of the well. 
		\pend
		\pstart
		And from the smoke there emerged grasshoppers (and they went out) upon the Earth, and they were given the (same) authority as the authority of the scorpions of the Earth. And they were told to not harm the grass of the Earth, nor any (all) green things nor any (all) tree, except for (they were allowed to harm) the humans who do not have the seal of God upon their foreheads. 
		\pend
		\pstart
		And it was given to them (the grasshoppers) so that they might not kill them (the unsealed), but so that they shall be tormented for five months; and their torment (was) like the torment of a scorpion when he strikes a person. And in those days, men will seek Death but shall not find him; they will yearn to die, but 	Death flees from them. 
		\pend
		\pstart
		And the appearance of the grasshoppers was like that of horses preparing (themselves to go) into battle and upon their heads are (placed things that look like) crowns — (which are in appearance) like gold — and their faces are like the faces of men; and they have a mane (hairs) like the hair of women and their teeth were like (those) of lions. And they had breastplates (which looked) like iron breastplates and the voice (sound) of the their wings (was) as the voice of a chariot of horses marching into battle (going to war). 
		\pend
		\pstart
		And they have tails like (those of) scorpions and (they also have) stings (at the end of their tails?). And in their tails (is) the authority to hurt (all) the humans for five months. And they have (sitting?) upon them a king — the angel of the abyss — whose name, in Hebrew, is Abaddon and in the Greek language he has the name Apollyon. The first Woe departed — (but) look! There are coming yet two more Woes hereafter. 
		\pend
		\pstart
		And the sixth angel sounded (his trumpet). And I heard a voice (emerging) from the four horns of the golden altar before God telling the sixth angel — the one holding the trumpet —, “Release the four angels, the ones that are bound to (in) the great river Euphrates.” And the four angels were released, namely the ones who prepared (themselves) for the hour and the day and the year (during which) they might kill a third of the humans. And the number of the army of horsemen was two-hundred thousand thousands; I heard their number.
		\pend
		\pstart
		And thus (in this manner) I saw the horses in the vision and (I also saw those those) who sit upon them, having fiery, hyacinthine (purple) and brimstone-like (colour of sulfur) breastplates. And the heads of the horses (were) as the heads of lions, and from their mouths sprang forth fire and smoke and brimstone (sulfur).
		\pend 
		\pstart
		A third of the human (race) died from these three plagues — from the fire, and the smoke and the brimstone (sulfur) which sprang forth from their mouths. For the power (authority) of the horses is (placed) in(side) their mouth and in(side) their tails. For their tails are like snakes with (having) heads — and in (using them) they (do) harm. 
		\pend
		\pstart
		And the remaining humans, those who did neither die from those plagues nor repented of the works of their (own) hands that they should not worship demons and golden, silver, copper, wooden or stone idols — who (the idols) can neither see nor listen nor walk about; and (those humans who) neither repented of their (committed) murders nor of their drug-usage (magic, sorcery) nor of their sexual immorality nor of their (committed) thefts.
