			The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show His servants what must soon happen; and He made it known through the sending of His messenger to His servant John, who confirms everything that he saw, namely the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. Blessed is the reader and the people who listen to the words of the prophecy and (blessed is) the one who heeds what is written in it (the prophecy), for the time is near.

			(A letter of) John to the seven churches in Asia (Minor): Grace to you and peace from the One who is and who was and who will come; and from the seven spirits which are in front of His throne; and from Jesus Christ — the faithful witness —, the first-born of the dead and ruler of the kings of the Earth.

			To the One who loves us and who frees from our sins with His blood; and who made us a kingdom and (made us) priests to His father and God — To Him be the glory and the power into the eternity of eternities. Amen.

			Look, He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the Earth will mourn for Him. Yes, Amen.

			I — John, your brother and sharer in the suffering and kingdom and endurance in Jesus Christ, was — because of the word of God and the witness of Jesus — on the island called Patmos. I was in spirit (praying?) on the Day of the Lord and I heard a great voice behind me, like a trumpet, saying, “Write what you see into a scroll and send it to the seven churches, namely to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea.”
		\pend
		\pstart
			And I turned around to see the voice which was speaking with me, and when I turned around I saw seven golden lamp-stands; and in the midst of the lamp-stands was someone like (who was / looked like?) the Son of Man, clad in a long robe and having wrapped around his chest a golden belt. His head and His hair were white as wool, as white as snow; and His eyes (were) like a flaming flame and his feet were as (like) brass refined in a furnace; and His voice was like the voice of many waters and He had in His right hand seven stars; and out of His mouth came a sharp, double-edged sword; and His face shines like the Sun in His power.
		\pend
		\pstart
			And when I saw Him, I fell to His feet as if I was dead; and He put his right hand upon me, saying, “Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last and the Living One; and I was dead — but behold, I am living into the eternities of eternities and I have the keys of Death and Hades. Write, then, what you saw, what is and what will happen thereafter. The mystery of the seven stars which you see upon my right hand and the seven golden lamp-stands (is the following): The seven stars are messengers of the seven churches and the seven lamp-stands are the seven churches.
