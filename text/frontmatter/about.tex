My name is Marvin Johanning, I am 22 years old and currently reside in Bielefeld, a city in the north-west of Germany. I am currently attending an apprenticeship as an IT systems technician (\textit{IT-Systemelektroniker}) that I hope to finish by mid-2023. 

I am the maintainer of \url{ancient-greek.net}, a website containing lots of information on Ancient Greek, including book reviews and translations of various texts — amongst the latter are various portions of the New Testament and Herodotus’ Histories. 

I have also written another book, namely “The Intricacies of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphics”. It can be found under the following ISBN: 978-3-752952-49-0. Please note, however, that it can currently only be bought from Germany.
