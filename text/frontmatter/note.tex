As this book is not “copyrighted” in the traditional sense, I decided to write a short informational text here, explaining how you may legally attain your own (free) copy of my work, how you may use it and how to support me. 

First and foremost, it is important to note that I am not making a non-watermarked PDF file of this book freely available; you may, however, at any time, download its source-code and compile it into any format that you wish — this is made possible through my having written this book in \LaTeX. This compilation process requires a full \LaTeX\ installation and a \LaTeX\ compiler compatible with my book, preferably \XeLaTeX\ or Lua\LaTeX. I would advise against the usage of pdf\LaTeX, as it has not worked properly for me personally and may compile with formatting errors or it might even fail to compile the document altogether. For more information regarding the installation of a \TeX\ environment and the compilation of documents, please refer to the official \LaTeX\ website (\url{https://www.latex-project.org/}). Please note that the root document file is revelation.tex and compiling the book should therefore be as simple as typing “xelatex revelation.tex” (or the equivalent command for another compiler) in the project's main folder. 

After compilation, you may use the book — and your compiled document — in accordance with the Creative Commons BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license; feel free to share your compiled version with your colleagues and friends, but do not attempt to sell it without my prior approval. Additionally, should you wish to use my work for a purpose that is generally forbidden by the license, I encourage you to contact me — I am fairly certain we can come to an agreement.

If you wish to obtain an official copy of my book — either digitally or in print —, then I highly encourage you to check out my website for always up-to-date information regarding the availability of various editions; you can find this, and some additional information, by following the following link: \url{https://ancient-greek.net/books/revelation.php}. This webpage also contains downloads for both a watermarked PDF preview and the archived (usually a regular ZIP file) \LaTeX\ source code of the book; furthermore, you may find the source code on this book’s GitHub repository: \url{https://github.com/mjohanning99/Revelation-Translation}.
