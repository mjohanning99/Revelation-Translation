# The Apocalypse of John: a modern illustrated translation
![](images/cover.png)

This repository contains my translation of the Apocalypse of John (also known as the Revelation) of the New Testament. This is still a work-in-progress and will stay one for the foreseeable future. I am hoping to finish this book by late 2021.

What sets it apart from other translations is the generous amount of illustrations (a spread of pages, with one side containing a quote from the previous chapter and the other a painting relating to the content of aforesaid chapter can be found at the end of each chapter) and notes and comments in parentheses. The former will, hopefully, make the reading of the Revelation more interesting and provide some context for the events that are happening; and the latter will, I hope, enable people to read and understand the Revelation more easily.
